  aboutDescription: ` 
      Since 2010, Guinea has focused on 
      key industries to develop our economy.
                           
      We have created new strategic opportunities 
      to increase our competitiveness.
                            
      Discover how you can participate in Guinea’s
      growth, and tap into our high-performing sectors.`,
  energyDescription: `    
  Energy lies at the very heart of our development strategy, and all our
  investments in this sector improve our people’s lives and livelihoods.
  
  Hydropower is energy obtained from flowing water. One of the first 
  sources of energy used for electricity generation, it is also
  considered one of the most cost-effective. 
 
  Guinea has more than half of West Africa’s principal rivers. Since 2010,
  we have built new dams, rehabilitated and expanded our power grid, 
  and increased energy collaboration with our neighbors.`,
  tourismDescription: `
  The vast potential of tourism is still being realized. We are investing
  in our rich cultural heritage, and in the unspoilt beauty of our well-
  preserved landscapes.
  
  Yet to be explored by the world, Guinea offers rare experiences to
  adventurous travelers, and we are gearing up to welcome them in
  great numbers.

  Since 2010, we have improved our road infrastructure for quicker and
  easier travel, increased hotel offeringsby 40%, and created thousands
  of new jobs in the hospitality sector.`,
  infrastructureDescription: `
  Infrastructure is the cornerstone of our economic growth, and supports
  all sectors of Guinean industry and activity. We are determined to convert
  earlier weaknesses into key strengths, and create a sustainable future.
   
  Since 2010, we have invested heavily in infrastructure, building and
  rehabilitating our roads, airports, and ports. We are facilitating quicker 
  transport of people and goods and also improving living standards.
  
  We are mindful of protecting those in need, with new social housing 
  programs, health facilities, and schools across the country.`,
  agricultureDescription: `
  With over 13 million ha of arable land, a diverse climate, 1,160 waterways 
  and rainfalls averaging 120-430 cm, Guinea has the potential to be an
  agricultural powerhouse. For too long, less than 10% of cultivable
  land was exploited despite 85% of the population working in agriculture
  
  Since 2010, we have massively invested to modernize the sector through
  capacity-building of farmers, subsidizing farming inputs and supplying 
  modern machinery. We are undergoing a shift from small-scale subsistence
  farming to mass production, resulting in higher crop yields and exports.
  
  This contributes to making Guinea a regional agribusiness hub.
